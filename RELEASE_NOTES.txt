## 🎉 What's New

### Settings & Startup Control
• New Settings window: manage Run on Windows Startup and Media Player fullscreen behavior (Auto vs Default).
• Startup preference is applied when the app launches, and can be toggled from Settings.

### Video Progress Behavior
• Progress stays at 100% when a video completes (timestamp saved at full duration).
• Double-clicking a completed item starts it from the beginning; partial progress resumes from the saved timestamp.
• Stop button now saves progress before closing the player.

### Drag-to-Sort Reordering
• More reliable and intuitive reordering with a full-width insertion indicator.
• Index-based targeting ensures consistent drag behavior, including dropping at the end of the list.
• Fixes the out-of-bounds error seen when dropping near list boundaries.

### UI/UX Improvements
• Progress Indicator Pill turns pale green at 100% for easy recognition.
• Increased progress pill font size for readability; consistent black text.
• Playlists list now has a clear hover highlight that matches playlist items.
• Restored column headers (Progress, Title) for a consistent layout.
• Hidden grid splitter width for a cleaner two-column interface.
